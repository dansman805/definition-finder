# Definition Finder
When you do not want to deal with GUI's for words
-------------------------------------------------

This program takes an input of a word, finds the first definition of it on dictionary.com, prints it and adds it to your clipboard.



Use this in a folder with path access (it is a batch file, name it define):

@python "C:\Users\dansm\Desktop\Folders\Programming\Python\Python 2\Git\definition-finder\main.py" %1

With this you can just type "define [word]" into your terminal.
